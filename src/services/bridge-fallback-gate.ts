/**
 * Decision logic for "should the worker suppress its transcript-driven
 * fallback emit for this Lark turn?"
 *
 * Pure function with no I/O — kept separate from worker.ts so the rules
 * (including the type-ahead window and the adopt-vs-non-adopt branching)
 * can be tested deterministically. The worker reads marker entries from
 * disk and threads them through here.
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - Adopt mode never suppresses: in /adopt the model in the adopted
 *     session is unaware of botmux, so transcript drain is the ONLY
 *     channel from model to Lark. There's no `botmux send` to compete
 *     with, hence no marker to gate on.
 *   - Non-adopt + isLocal: suppress. A local-typing turn means the
 *     attribution queue saw a user event whose content didn't match any
 *     pending Lark fingerprint. In a worker-spawned CLI that's a Web
 *     terminal hand-typed input — the user is already looking at it, no
 *     reason to push it back to the Lark thread.
 *   - Non-adopt + send observed in window: suppress. The window is
 *     [turn.markTimeMs, nextBoundaryMs). Legacy markers only carry time,
 *     so any marker in the window still suppresses. Newer markers carry the
 *     normalized length of the explicit `botmux send` body. When the
 *     transcript final is available, only emit fallback if that final is
 *     materially longer than any single explicit send in the same window.
 *     This lets short progress updates surface a later substantive final
 *     answer, while same-size rewrites and short acknowledgements stay
 *     suppressed. Boundary handling intentionally also considers
 *     queue items that haven't reached "ready" yet (passed in via
 *     nextBoundaryMs) — without that, a model that's still mid-tool-use
 *     for turn N+1 could leak a send credit into turn N's window.

/** Some structured CLIs can report a durable completed turn while their
 * terminal event carries no final text. If there was no explicit `botmux send`
 * in that turn window, silently completing leaves the Lark thread with no
 * visible outcome. Emit a diagnostic fallback only for that narrow case.
 *
 * Scope note (shared path): this gate feeds worker.ts:emitReadyCodexTurns,
 * which is shared by every structured-bridge CLI (Codex / Traex / Cursor / Pi /
 * Grok / Hermes / Mtr / Coco). In practice only two of them can produce an
 * empty-finalText `assistant_final` that reaches here:
 *   - Traex — `task_complete` with an empty `last_agent_message`
 *     (terminalStatus undefined → treated as completed below);
 *   - Grok  — `turn_completed` + stop_reason `end_turn` where the post-tool
 *     buffer is empty (terminalStatus 'completed').
 * The other six drainers drop empty text before enqueue (`if (!text) continue`),
 * so the fallback is unreachable for them.
 *
 * terminalStatus dependency: `undefined` is admitted as "completed" for
 * back-compat with legacy assistant_final events. This relies on Traex encoding
 * a cancel/abort as `turn_aborted` (terminalStatus 'ambiguous', excluded here)
 * rather than as an empty `task_complete`. If that fork contract ever changes,
 * a cancelled turn could surface a spurious "completed but empty" diagnostic.
 *
 * Marker caveat: `shouldSuppressBridgeEmit` only sees `botmux send` markers, and
 * detoured sends (`--top-level` / `--into` / `--override-chat`) intentionally
 * write no marker (cli.ts shouldRecordBridgeMarker). A turn whose only visible
 * reply went out via such a send therefore still trips this diagnostic; the
 * user-facing string (i18n `worker.empty_final_completed`) is worded to account
 * for that case rather than asserting no send happened. */
